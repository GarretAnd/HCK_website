## Description
For my Landing Page I decided to mimic certain aspects from a lot of different websites to creating a Landing Page for the Volunteer Food Kitchen I run, Hanover Community Kitchen. This page can be found in the link above both on mobile and on desktop.

## Websites I Imitated
https://ecga.org/  
https://bcfymca.org/  
https://www.patagonia.com/home/  
https://monday.com/
https://simpleanalytics.com/  
https://www.malala.org/

## What Worked Well
- I think my fonts and spacing for pages worked really well when adjusting between medias given that I based a lot of my font/image size dependent on the screen size, rather than hard coding values.
- My past experience in html/css and working through the flexbox froggy game really helped me get a good grasp of flexbox and allowed me to display content in a way I was really happy with.
- I was able to encorporate a lot of different little extra credit things into the project in a choesive manner and I was really happy about that.

## What Didn't Work Well
- I think the hamburger menu could use some work. I initially had a hamburger menu in both desktop and mobile but upon looking at the instructions realized I coudln't do this. So I changed the header in the desktop mode and honestly like it a lot less.
- I have a hackerish way to hide the background and content of the hamburger menu that looks okay but I think could be done way better.
- I think my overall design of the page is okay but I don't 100% love it. Design is hard. 

## Extra Credit
- I made the hamburger menu in mobile able to be clicked out of without having to click the X in the corner. I did this by putting the ul tag in a larger div and expanded that background, than whenever that background was clicked it would close out the menu.
- I made the section headers for the links at the bottom clickable to expand and display information using the CSS Checkbox hack
- I managed to create a carousel effect based off of patagonias website with arrows.
- I added a typerwriter effect to the photo gallery heading 
- A lot of my elements have hover effects and some change colors when you click on them
- The hamburger menu has a sorta cool effect where it covers the screen in like a white wave when you open up the menu
